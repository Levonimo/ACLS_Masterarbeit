Configurations for Remote Hosts and Help Path

adapted from David Patsch's AlphaDock

    - set up remote hosts with a dictionary where the key is your remote address and then additional 
    configuratins in a nested dictionary the alias describes the displayed name for your server, 
    num_cpu the amount of cpus that can be used (0 => disabled) and then the port you connect to 
    the docker container on. 77 is the default. dont change this unless you have to (then you have 
    to expose a different port in your docker too)
          hosts={
            "localhost": { # this will connect to localhost, and display "local" in the list of remotes
              "alias": "local" #the gui will display your localhost as local in the list of hosts
              "num_cpu": 64 #docking runs will be allowed 64 cpu cores
              "connect_on_port": 77 # by default the port 77 will connect to 22 (ssh default) on the docker 
            },  
          }

    - set up help path which is linked to the internal wiki page
